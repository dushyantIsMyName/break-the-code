Problem:

Given a number N, print sum of all even numbers from 1 to N.
Input Format :
Integer N
Output Format :
Required Sum 
Sample Input 1 :
 6
Sample Output 1 :
12

Code:

/*
	Pre-requisite to solve this problem:
	In this question, we have to find sum of all even numbers till n. To take sum of all the even numbers, we have to take a variable and initialize it to zero. Let us name this variable as sum. 
	Following code is used to add 2 to sum variable and update it to the same sum variable:
	sum = sum + 2 
	
	Hint to solve this problem: We will have to loop on even numbers only and add the even numbers to the same sum variable, described above.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


int main(){
    int i,n,sum=0;
    i=0;
    cin>>n;
    while(i<=n){
            sum=sum+i;
            i=i+2;
        }
    cout<<sum<<endl;
}
